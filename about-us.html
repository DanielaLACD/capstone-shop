  <h3>What is a Chicana?</h3>
  <p>
    The most popular definition of a Chicana is a Mexican-American female who is raised in the United States.  La Chicana “has minority status in her own land even though she is, in part, indigenous to the Americas and a member of one of the largest (majority) ethnic groups in the United States.  She is a woman whose life is too often characterized by poverty  racism, and sexism, not only in the dominant culture, but also within her own culture”1
  The term Chicana was coined during the Chicano Movement by Mexican American women who wanted to establish social, cultural, and political identities for themselves in America.  Chicana refers to a woman who embracers her Mexican culture and heritage, but simultaneously, recognizes the fact that she is an American.  It is a self-selected term that usually applies to those Mexican-American women who acknowledge a dominance of males in society, and a history of discrimination and neglect in both the household and the workplace.

<h3>How did the Radical Chicana Feminist Movement Take Form?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the main events that sparked the Chicana movement was the 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference. More than 1500 young men and women gathered over Easter weekend in March of that year.  The conference was held in Denver, CO and was sponsored by the Crusade for Justice.  It was at this meeting that “Chicano  issues first gained a national platform,” and this is where the self-defining term “Chicano” was adopted.
The conference focused on The Plan del Espiritu Aztlan, and was led by leaders such as Corky Gonzalez, and workers like Juanita Dominguez, Pricilla Salazar, and Marcella Lucero Trujillo.  At this conference, women began to incorporate themselves into the male-dominated discussions, and rallied together to address feminist concerns at the meeting.  They wanted to deal with not only issues of racism, but also sexism within their households.  After leaving this conference, women went back to their communities as activists, and as a result, this signified the beginning of the Chicana Feminist Movement.

    After this 1969 conference, women across the U.S. organized many small activist groups in their community.  This resulted in the formation of many different organizations, such as La Raza Unida Party. This party was founded in Crystal City, Texas, a town of about 10,000 Mexican Americans, who made up 80% of the town’s population.3  Because of the segregation practices at the local high school, community leaders began to protest against the educational inequality between whites and Mexican-Americans.  Leaders such as Luz Gutierrez, Martha Cotera, and Rosie Castro took action beyond Crystal City and fought to reform the education system through the use of laws and public policy.
